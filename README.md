# Features:

***-Performs operation in the real time, following the MDAS (Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) order***

***-Everything can be deleted with "<-" button. Elements deleted one by one get calculated in the real time as well.***

***-Two color themes: Light and Dark (colors can be changed in xml file)***

***-Stricts inputting more than one after another operator (new operator rewrites the old one)***

***-Stricts inputting more than one decimal to each number. If decimal is pressed when there is no number, adds 0 to it (e.g [10+.5] becomes [10+0.5])***

***-Stricts inputting few 0 in a row, if there is no decimal (can't input 000)***

***-Formats Input and Output fields, adding commas (e.g. 10,000 / 1,000). Decimal replaces commas (e.g. 100,000 > [.5] > 100000.5)***

***-Upon trying to delete by 0, shows error message: "Can't divide by zero". After that, pressing any button resets calculation***
