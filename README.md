# Features:

-Operates in real-time, following the MDAS (Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) order.

-You can delete everything with "<-" button. Elements are deleted one by one and calculated in real-time as well.

-Two available color themes: Light and Dark (you can change the colors in an XML file).

-Strict inputting more than one after another operator (new operator rewrites the old one).

-Strict inputting more than one decimal to each number. If you press decimal when there is no number, adds 0 to it (e.g [10+.5] becomes [10+0.5]).

-Strict inputting few 0 in a row, if there is no decimal (can't input 000).

-Formats Input and Output fields, adding commas (e.g. 10,000 / 1,000). Decimal replaces commas (e.g. 100,000 > [.5] > 100000.5).

-Upon trying to divide by 0, it shows an error message: "Can't divide by zero." After that, pressing any button resets the calculation.
